# 10-JavaScript-Projects

## Introduction
I created this project in an attempt to improve my skills in JavaScript, and since I'm not creative enough to come up with my own project ideas, I turned to the internet. This brought me to an article on skillcrush.com written by Scott Morris titled "Here are 10 Projects You Can Do To Build Your JavaScript Skills". The article itself actually contains 21, however I am going to start with the first 10.

## Projects

1.  Javascript Clock
2.  Restaraunt Tip Calculator
3.  Animated Navigation Toggle
4.  Interactive Javascript Map
5.  Javascript Game
6.  Mouseover Element Project
7.  Login Authenticator
8.  Javascript Drawing
9.  Javascript Todo List
10. Javascript Quiz

Bonus Project: Terminalizer 
    - Record your terminal and turn that recording into a GIF

## Contributions 
If you would like to contribute to this project, please create your own directory for your version of the program. For an example, if you are working on your own clock app, you'd create a directory like /10-JavaScript-Projects/Javascript Clock/John Doe. Since these projects are so basic, and there are so many different possible implementations, it makes more sense to set it up this way.
